                Housing price prediction
                Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to a north-south railroad. 
                 
                House price negotiations often have a lot of influencing factors and not just the number of bedrooms or the position of the kitchen.Take the given dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. In this hackathon, predict the final price of each home. The application should be modeled using Machine Learning, you may explore libraries such as PySpark. Apply containerization principles as a better software engineering practice. You may explore Kafka server for streaming the data.

                The model can be deployed using Docker containers for scalability.
